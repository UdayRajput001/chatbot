ChatBot Web Application
This is a simple ChatBot web application where you can chat with a bot and view the conversation history. The backend is built with FastAPI, and the frontend is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

main.py
Backend: The main.py file handles the logic for the ChatBot.
API Endpoints:
POST /chat/: Accepts the user's message and sends a bot response.
GET /history/: Retrieves and shows the chat history.
The code is written using FastAPI, a Python framework for building APIs.
I used Ollama and Llama 3.2 models to generate responses from the bot.
index.html
Frontend: The index.html file is the user interface where you can interact with the ChatBot.
It features a clean and attractive design, with user messages shown on the right and bot responses on the left.
Users can type their messages, click "Send," and view past conversations with the "Show History" button.
Tools Used
I downloaded Ollama and used the Llama 3.2 model to power the bot's responses.
The code for both files was written to integrate the frontend with the backend, creating a seamless chat experience.
